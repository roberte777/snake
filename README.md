# Snake AI - A dive into GP and Neural Nets

## Goals

My goals with this project are to implement GP, NN, and Neuro Evolution in Rust.
I have just started learning all these topics, so I wanted to explore them solo
for the first time with an easier project, snake!

## Crates

- gym: Contains the actual game, should use game struct as interface with the game.
  Because I suck at coding, that might not be possible, but that is my goal by the end.
- genetic_ai: Contains the GP implementation.

## Run

```
cargo run
```
